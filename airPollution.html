            Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air—pollutants which are detrimental to human
            health and the planet as a whole. <br>
            According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year air pollution is responsible for nearly
            seven million deaths around the globe. <br>
            Nine out of ten human beings currently breathe air that exceeds the WHO’s guideline limits for
            pollutants, with those living in low- and middle-income countries suffering the most. <br>
            In the United States, the Clean Air Act, established in 1970, authorizes the U.S. Environmental
            Protection Agency (EPA) to safeguard public health by regulating the emissions of these harmful air
            pollutants.

            “Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air
            Project, part of the Climate and Clean Energy program at NRDC. <br>
            “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive
            feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. <br>
            “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says.
            “Another type of air pollution, smog, is then worsened by that increased heat, forming when the weather
            is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the production of
            allergenic air pollutants, including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused by extreme weather and
            increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season). <br>
            The effects of air pollution on the human body vary depending on the type of pollutant and the length
            and level of exposure—as well as other factors, including a person’s individual health risks and the
            cumulative impacts of multiple pollutants or stressors.

            These are the two most prevalent types of air pollution: Smog (sometimes referred to as ground-level
            ozone) occurs when emissions from combusting fossil fuels react with sunlight. <br>
            Soot (also known as particulate matter) is made up of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust, or
            allergens—in the form of either gas or solids—that are carried in the air. <br>
            The sources of smog and soot are similar. <br>
            “Both come from cars and trucks, factories, power plants, incinerators, engines, generally anything that
            combusts fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or natural gas,” Walke says. <br>
            Smog can irritate the eyes and throat and also damage the lungs, especially those of children, senior
            citizens, and people who work or exercise outdoors. <br>
            It’s even worse for people who have asthma or allergies: these extra pollutants can intensify their
            symptoms and trigger asthma attacks. <br>
            The tiniest airborne particles in soot, whether gaseous or solid, are especially dangerous because they
            can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream and worsen bronchitis, lead to heart attacks, and even hasten
            death. In 2020 a report from Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health showed COVID-19 mortality
            rates in areas with more soot pollution were higher than in areas with even slightly less, showing a
            correlation between the virus’s deadliness and long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and
            illuminating an environmental justice issue.

        <h2 class="secondary">So, what can we do?</h2>
        <p class="par">
            Drive your car less. Vehicle exhaust is a major source of air pollution in Minnesota. Carpool. Bike.
            Bus. Telecommute. Electric vehicles. How could you burn less fuel?
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Turn off your engine. An idling engine creates a hot spot of pollution. Buses and big trucks produce
            particularly unhealthy exhaust. Parents and teachers can help their schools and daycares develop and
            implement no-idling policies.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Don't burn your garbage. Burning your household garbage is dangerous to your health and our environment,
            and generally against the law in Minnesota. If you're still using a burn barrel, wood stove, or fire-pit
            for your trash, contact your county about arranging for trash hauling services.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Plant and care for trees. Trees filter pollutants and absorb carbon dioxide. Trees also release oxygen
            into the atmosphere and help cool our homes.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Switch to electric or hand-powered lawn equipment. <br>
            Gas-powered engines like those on lawnmowers and leaf or snow blowers often lack pollution control
            devices. An hour running a lawn mower can produce nearly the same amount of pollution as a 100-mile car
            trip! Use hand-powered or electric lawn care equipment instead.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Use less energy. <br>
            Choose efficient appliances and heating systems. <br>
            Get an energy audit and follow the advice. <br>
            Turn off electrical stuff you are not using. It all adds up.
