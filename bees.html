        <h2 id="indexh2">The risks and dangers of bee extinction</h2>
        <p class="par">
            The blue skies and blooming flowers of spring also bring with them the buzzing of bees, who emerge from
            their hives in search of pollen. <br>
            While small in size, their contributions to our ecosystems are momentous; put simply, life on Earth as
            it is today would not exist without bees. <br>
            Over millions of years, bees have evolved to help them pollinate flowers, even gaining little pollen
            pouches to carry larger loads; flowers have also evolved to attract bees and other pollinators and
            largely depend on them for reproduction. Which is why their disappearance is worrying:
            <br>
            over the past century, bee populations have plummeted and some have even been labelled as endangered,
            leaving their ecosystems - and our food chains - at risk of collapse

        <h2 id="indexh2">Why are bees endangered?</h2>
        <p class="par">
            Bees are at risk of extinction largely due to human activities: <br>
            large-scale changes in land use, industrialised agricultural practices, like monocultures, and the
            detrimental use of pesticides have all contributed to destroying their habitats and reducing their
            available food sources. <br>
            Globalisation has also facilitated the transmission of parasites and other invasive species that prey on
            bees, like the Asian hornet, which can decimate entire hives in hours. <br>
            Global warming also plays a large role in the endangerment of the bee population. Rising temperatures,
            increased flooding, droughts and changes in blooming seasons of flowering plants all affect the bees’
            ecosystems, reducing their suitability to the environment and threatening their survival.

        <h2 class="secondary">How can we help the bees?</h2>
        <p class="par">
            Just as flowers and bees provide mutually beneficial exchanges, humans - all of whom benefit from bees’
            pollinating activities - should help foster the health of bees.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Banning dangerous pesticides: The European Food Safety Committee (EFSA) has stated that three major
            pesticides pose a “high acute risk” to bee species and have been found in dangerous levels within their
            hives. Governments must ensure that approved pesticides are not harmful to pollinator populations, which
            in the long-run will help increase crop yield and promote sustainable farming.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Prevent and reverse habitat loss: Without adequate environments for bees to build homes and have
            plentiful food sources, their populations will continue to decline. Preventing deforestation can
            therefore also prevent bee extinction and, as a side effect, promote higher crop yields.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Buy organic produce: Organic produce is grown without the use of pesticides and therefore does not have
            chemicals that can kill bees.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Plant flowers and plants that bees pollinate: If you have a garden, you can plant certain plants that
            attract bees and other pollinators. Make sure to plant using organic seeds and avoid using fungicides or
            pesticides.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Buy local honey: Local honey producers support bee populations, but need income to support their farms
            and themselves. Buying locally will help small-scale farmers survive, while also helping the
            biodiversity of plants and the bee communities in your area.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Do not kill bee hives: While many people are afraid of bees, it is important to understand that they are
            mostly harmless unless provoked. In fact, not all bees sting - some species do not possess stinging
            abilities, and male bees do not sting at all. Even female bees that do sting will only sting if directly
            threatened or attacked. If you don't feel comfortable with bees around, you can contact a local
            beekeeper association that will relocate the bees to a new home.
